# Nuke.Common transition shim

This package is a **partial transition shim** for projects mid-migration from NUKE to Fallout. Published only to GitHub Packages — `Nuke.Common` on nuget.org is owned by the original NUKE maintainer.

## What's covered

| Old (`Nuke.Common`) | New (`Fallout.Common`) | Shim mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `NukeBuild` | `FalloutBuild` | Subclass |
| `INukeBuild` | `IFalloutBuild` | Sub-interface |
| `[Parameter]` | `Fallout.Common.ParameterAttribute` | Subclass |
| `[Secret]` | `Fallout.Common.SecretAttribute` | Subclass |
| `[Solution]` | `Fallout.Common.ProjectModel.SolutionAttribute` | Subclass |
| `[GitRepository]` | `Fallout.Common.Git.GitRepositoryAttribute` | Subclass |

The MVP unblocks a `class Build : NukeBuild` declaration with parameter/secret/solution/git injection — the entry-point surface of most consumer Build.cs files.

## What's NOT covered (yet)

- **CI attributes** (`[GitHubActions]`, `[AzurePipelines]`, `[TeamCity]`, `[AppVeyor]`, ...) — these take enum parameters (`GitHubActionsImage`, etc.) that the shim doesn't re-export. C# can't subclass enums; bridging them needs a source generator. Tracked in the follow-up issue.
- **The `Target` delegate** — delegates can't be implicitly converted across types in C#, so the shim can't bridge `Nuke.Common.Target Compile => _ => _` cleanly. Use `fallout-migrate` for the source-level rename.
- **Static helper classes** — `DotNetTasks`, `MSBuildTasks`, etc. require method-by-method delegation. Tracked for the source-generator follow-up.
- **IO types** — `AbsolutePath`, file globbing helpers — also need wrapper classes with mirrored members.

## Packaging

The shim packs normally as a build artifact (`Nuke.Common.<version>.nupkg`). The release pipeline's `Publish` target filters `Nuke.*` packages out of the nuget.org push — that ID is owned by the original NUKE maintainer. The produced nupkg can be uploaded to GitHub Packages or attached to a GitHub release.

Until automated dual-publish lands (tracked in [#69](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/69)), the manual GH Packages push is:

```pwsh
dotnet pack src/Shims/Nuke.Common/Nuke.Common.csproj -c Release
dotnet nuget push **/Nuke.Common.*.nupkg `
    --api-key $env:GITHUB_TOKEN `
    --source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ChrisonSimtian/index.json
```

## Migration path

For projects that just want their `class Build : NukeBuild { ... }` to compile against our framework:

1. Add `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ChrisonSimtian/index.json` as a NuGet source (`nuget.config`).
2. Bump the `Nuke.Common` package version to the latest published here.
3. Build. If the shim covers what you use, you're done. Otherwise:
4. Run `fallout-migrate` to rewrite the remaining references.

## What this shim is NOT

- Not a permanent dependency — designed for a transition window.
- Not a replacement for the migration story — most consumers should run `fallout-migrate` and target `Fallout.Common` directly.
- Not on nuget.org — only on this fork's GitHub Packages feed.

## Future work

Source-generator-based expansion to cover the full public API is tracked in the issue tracker. The architectural decision is between:

1. **Per-package shims** with hand-written wrappers (this approach, doesn't scale to all 158 public types in Common alone).
2. **Generated wrappers** from a Roslyn source generator that reflects the canonical assembly metadata — single source of truth, mechanical regeneration.

(2) is the long-term answer. (1) is what shipped first.
